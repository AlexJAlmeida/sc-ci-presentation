	abstract = {Probably because of their interpretability and transparent nature, synthetic controls have become widely applied in empirical research in economics and the social sciences. This article aims to provide practical guidance to researchers employing synthetic control methods. The article starts with an overview and an introduction to synthetic control estimation. The main sections discuss the advantages of the synthetic control framework as a research design, and describe the settings where synthetic controls provide reliable estimates and those where they may fail. The article closes with a discussion of recent extensions, related methods, and avenues for future research. (JEL B41, C32, C54, E23, F15, O47)},

            We examine the average causal impact of catastrophic natural disasters on economic growth by combining information from comparative case studies. For each country affected by a large disaster, we compute the counterfactual by constructing synthetic controls. We find that only extremely large disasters have a negative effect on output in both the short and the long runs. However, we also show that this results from two events where radical political revolutions followed the disasters. Once we control for these political changes, even extremely large disasters do not display any significant effect on economic growth.},

We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In addition, we use the 1998–1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

First, we discuss new research on identification strategies in program evaluation, with particular focus on synthetic control methods, regression discontinuity, external validity, and the causal interpretation of regression methods. Second, we discuss various forms of supplementary analyses, including placebo analyses as well as sensitivity and robustness analyses, intended to make the identification strategies more credible. Third, we discuss some implications of recent advances in machine learning methods for causal effects, including methods to adjust for differences between treated and control units in high-dimensional settings, and methods for identifying and estimating heterogenous treatment effects.},

	abstract = {The terms “randomization test” and “permutation test” are sometimes used interchangeably. However, there are both historical and conceptual reasons for making a clear distinction between the two terms. Using a historical perspective, this chapter emphasizes the contributions made by Edwin Pitman and Bernard Welch to arrive at a coherent theory for randomization and permutation tests. From a conceptual perspective, randomization tests are based on random assignment and permutation tests are based on random sampling. The justification of the randomization test derives from the fact that under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, the random assignment procedure produces a random shuffle of the responses. The justification of the permutation test derives from the fact that under the null hypothesis of identical distributions, all permutations of the responses are equally likely. It is argued that this terminological distinction is crucial for recognizing the assumptions behind each of the tests and for appreciating the validity of the corresponding inferences.},
